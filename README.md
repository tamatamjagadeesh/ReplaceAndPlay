 Position Replace Game is a simple Python-based game where players pick a position (0, 1, or 2) in a list and replace the current value with a new string. The updated list is displayed, and players can choose to continue or stop the game. It's a basic interactive program designed to practice list manipulation and user input handling in Python.
# Position Replace Game

This is a simple Python game where the user picks a position in a list (0, 1, or 2) and replaces the current value with a new string. The game continues until the user decides to stop.

## How the Game Works:

1. The user is shown the current list of three elements (initially `[0, 1, 2]`).
2. The user selects a position (0, 1, or 2) to replace.
3. The user inputs a string to replace the value at the chosen position.
4. The updated list is displayed.
5. The user is asked whether they want to keep playing.
6. If the user chooses "Y" (Yes), the game repeats; if "N" (No), the game ends.
